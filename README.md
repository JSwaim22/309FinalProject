This project models the popular Connect 4 tabletop game using C++. 
The game works exactly as the traditional phyical game does.

To compile the code, download the repository and then open the connect_four.cpp file in your C++ compiler of choice. It will work on any operating system that supports a C++ compiler.

A cool feature is watching the computers play each other.

There are no known bugs in the software.
